### Style
`chessmate` utilizes [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) for general formatting and [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for overall style. Using an automatic pep8 enforcer such as [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) followed by `isort` and `black` would ensure all code follows the same standards
